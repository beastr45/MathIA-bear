This is a collection of files that I use in my math assesment.
In this collection Ive included the source for the IA and some scripts I used to make visuals.
Hopefully there is also a completed source code for a simple rotation example.

This collection is also used as an alternative to google drive so my essay can be updated on the 'cloud'

Likely the only important file is the actual assesment If you wish to grab the files github will allow you to download them as a zip file
